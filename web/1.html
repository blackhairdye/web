    <h2>HEAVEN HILL HERITAGE COLLECTION</h2>
    We’re proud to introduce a new collection of extra-aged, ultra-premium American Whiskeys to our portfolio.
    The Heaven Hill Heritage Collection exemplifies the true craftsmanship, patience and consistency that are hallmarks of our 85+ years of whiskey-making traditions.
    With new editions <strong>released <u>every spring</u></strong>, this collection features Straight American Whiskeys from one of our six traditional mashbills.
    Ages vary by release but all editions feature our oldest stocks of barrels.
    <p><a href="https://blog.heavenhilldistillery.com/detail.php?post_name=introducing-the-heaven-hill-heritage-collection/" target="_blank" title="HEAVEN HILL HERITAGE COLLECTION">The first edition of the Heaven Hill Heritage Collection</a> is a 17-year-old Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey.
    Bottled straight from the barrel without chill filtering, this 118.2 proof whiskey showcases our traditional Bourbon mashbill of 78% corn, 10% rye and 12% malted barley.</p>

    <p>A mingling of 17-, 19- and 20-year-old Bourbons, the collection uniquely shares in-depth liquid and production information on the label for added transparency.
    The first edition’s label highlights the percentages of various Bourbon ages, as well as which rickhouses the barrels were pulled from. Attributes on the label will vary by release.</p>
